## Self-hosting
We do not recommend self-hosting the bot, but it's always an option. To selfhost the bot yourself, you need to have:
* Node - confirmed working on v16.8.0
* npm - comes with Node, the version shouldn't really matter
* discord.js - v13 or higher
* A Discord bot token, and having the bot in your server
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/AquaSolutions) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Do `npm i` inside the folder, and wait for it to finish.
* Create a file `.env` in the root of the folder and paste `TOKEN=<TOKEN>`. Change `<TOKEN>` to your discord bot token.
* Change `/src/config.json` with the values of your server.

After all this, start the bot with `npm run start`.

> ### âš  Warning 
> There is literally no warranty if you self-host AquaSolutions, and we will not help you set it up either. If you wish to set the bot up yourself, we expect you have well enough knowledge in Node.js.
